\begin{frame}\frametitle{Why Scratch? Good introduction to programming}
    % But more importantly Scratch is used by many schools and universities to introduce students to the principles of programming
    % Scratch is very suitable for this task for multiple reasons
    Many schools and universities deploy Scratch as a gentle introduction to programming.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Why Scratch? Good introduction to programming}
    % For one thing, Scratch makes it impossible to write invalid code
    % The block-based code system eliminates the possibility of syntax errors
    % Blocks are chosen from a drawer
    % And even variable names can't be misspelled since they are chosen from a list
    % This all helps make Scratch very intuitive to use

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Why automated testing for Scratch?}
    Grading Scratch assignments is very time consuming
    \begin{itemize}
        \item every project has to be opened individually
        \item programs require large amounts of user interaction
    \end{itemize}

    \bigskip

    % TODO citation
    Some courses are attended by a large number of students ($> 200$), making manual grading infeasible.

    \bigskip

    Students can also use automated tests to get feedback for their own implementations.
