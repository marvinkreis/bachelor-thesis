\begin{frame}\frametitle{Conclusion}
    Automating Scratch's IO is a viable way to perform functional testing on Scratch programs.
    Both traditional tests and property-based tests are usable for this purpose.

    Evaluation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tests are able to produce test results that closely match the results of manual grading.
        \item Automated input generation is able achieve high coverage on a variety of different Scratch programs.
    \end{itemize}

%     Tests can:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item simulate user input
%         \item access the program's sprites and attributes
%         \item control the program execution
%     \end{itemize}

%
%     Property-based testing: perform checks in the background
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item callbacks observe the program
%         \item constraints define conditions
%         \item (input generation controls the program)
%     \end{itemize}

    Future Work:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Electron-UI to facilitate testing large numbers of projects
        \item Reduce test code by offering helper functions
    \end{itemize}
