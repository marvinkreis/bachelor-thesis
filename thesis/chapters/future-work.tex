\chapter{Future Work}

- Simulate user input for extensions

- Check for sounds played

- Support for scratch extensions

- Make writing tests easier / more comfortable
    - Tests are very long and complex
    $\rightarrow$ take very long to write $\rightarrow$ only useful if reused at the moment

- More fine grained control over ''old'' values

- More fine grained control over callbacks
    - Hook into different events, e.g. execute a function when a certain sprite moves or changes size

- More fine grained control over constraints
    - Give options about when a constraint is checked, e.g. every step, when a value changes, etc.

- Library of pre-defined constraints to choose from
