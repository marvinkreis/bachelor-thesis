         1 & 2 & Catching an apple gives the player 5 points, catching a banana gives 8 points. \\
         2 & 2 & Apples and bananas fall with different speeds. apples' y-coordinate is changed by~-5, bananas' y-coordinate is changed is changed by~-7. \\
         3 & 3 & When an apple touches the red line, it must display the message ''Game over!'' and end the game. \\
         4 & 3 & When a banana touches the red line, it must display the message ''-8'' and subtract~8~points. \\
         5 & 2 & The timer ticks backwards from 30 to 0. \\
         6 & 1 & No two fruit of the same type must fall down at the same time. \\
         7 & 2 & Apples and bananas have a size of 50\%. \\
         8 & 2 & Spawn point of the fruit: x-axis: random / y-axis: 170. \\
         9 & 2 & Fruits fall down in a straight line. \\
        10 & 3 & When the timer reaches 0, the bowl must display the message ''Ende!'' and end the game. \\
        11 & 3 & When a fruit touches the bowl, the score is changed and it again falls down from a random position with y = 170. \\
        12 & 3 & The bowl can only be moved horizontally with the arrow keys. It moves in steps of~10 and starts at x = 0 / y = -145. \\
        13 & 4 & The banana must wait one second before falling down when the game starts and after touching the ground. It must not be visible during that time. \\
