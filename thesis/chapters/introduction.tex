\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview}
=== What is scratch and why does it matter
- Movement to educational, interactive programming languages in introductory courses
- Scratch is one of the widest spread educational programming language
- Its interactive environment lets users easily build animated interactive programs

=== What purpose does automatic testing have in this context
- Manual assessment of scratch programs is very time consuming
- Interactive nature of scratch programs means much interaction is needed to test the program
- Every project has to be opened Individually
- In contrast, traditional programming languages that feature normal IO can easily be assessed
- Simply provide input and check output
- This is not so simple for Scratch

=== What purpose does it have
- Allows teachers to grade scratch programs more easily
    - Less time consuming
        - There are programming courses using Scratch that have over 200 students \cite{itch}
    - may catch easily overlooked errors
    - Gives students an easy way to get feedback for their programs
        - Can detect errors or functionality, which they might have missed
- What can learners do with it?
    - Can serve as a extension to a self-tutorial
    - Gives feedback to the learner

\section{Contributions}
- This work introduces whisker as a way to automatically assess the functionality of scratch programs
- Whisker follows a black box GUI testing approach
- Provides a automation tool to control scratch programs from test cases
    - Can simulate input on the program
    - Can query information from the program

- This work shows that automated testing can be used to assess scratch programs
- \textbf{RQ1:} Whisker can facilitate grading of Scratch assignments
    - Whisker's results (normal tests and constraint tests) match the results of manual evaluation
    - Whisker's results (normal tests and constraint tests) show low rates of false positives and false negatives
    - Whisker's results (normal tests and constraint tests) are consistent enough to be used for grading
- \textbf{RQ2:} The testing process can be done entirely in the background independent of testing scenarios (?)
    $\rightarrow$ \textbf{RQ2.1:} Random input can be used for the test
    ($\rightarrow$ The test can involve the user using the program like they normally would)
