\begin{abstract}
    - Scratch is very common as an introduction to programming
    - Workshops and courses are held with Scratch
    - Many people pick up Scratch on their own and follow tutorials

    - Assessment of Scratch programs is still an open problem
        - Teachers might want to check their student's programs to grade them or to compile statistics
        - Learners might want to check their own solutions and get feedback

    - Automatic assessment of Scratch programs is needed
        - basic static analysis possible
        - runtime testing is not really possible yet
        - Scratch does not have normal input / output like traditional programs, but is based on multimedia
        - programs need to be run manually to assess their functionality
        - takes a lot of effort
        - Whisker can support educators and learners in the assessment

    - Whisker allows GUI testing for Scratch
        - Allows to write test cases in JavaScript that executed the program, simulate user input and check sprite properties

    - Whisker was tested on a collection of Scratch programs written by students
    - Evaluation shows ...
