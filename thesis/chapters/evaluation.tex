\chapter{Evaluation}

- In this chapter, the Whisker testing utility is evaluated
- The focus of the evaluation lies in comparing the results of automated tests using Whisker to the results of manual assessment
- Additionally the results of using random input in conjunction to constraint-only tests is explored

- A collection of real Scratch programs from a student course is tested with four different test suites
- The first two test suites try to assess the projects as well as possible
- The second two test suites are used to find out if randomly generated user input can reasonably be used together with a constraint-only test suite

- Chapter outline

\section{Evaluation Method}
\subsection{Projects}
- From a students course
- Two groups, grade 6 and grade 7 $\rightarrow$ realistic for Whisker's purpose
- Multiple exercises to familiarize themselves with Scratch
- Build up to final, most complex, project
- Project has a clear description that stretches about half a DIN A4 page $\rightarrow$ well defined

=== Are these projects suitable for evaluating Whisker?
- Complexity on the higher end of what Whisker is supposed to be used for
- Game Over state makes it hard to assess other properties if the program goes game over because of a bug
    - E.g. one project would often go game over when an apple touches the borders on the sides
    - Well defined $\rightarrow$ tests can be written without looking at the projects (but often problematic, e.g. clones, inexact implementations)
- Students were not aware of the fact, that their projects would be subjected to automated assessment later
    - Students often deliberately changed their programs from the specification (e.g. different fall speeds, different messages)
    - In a real scenario (in which Whisker is used for grading) students would have the possibility to test their projects beforehand

\subsection{Tests}
- Normal + Constraint Tests
    - Deliberately control the bowl to win the game

- Normal Tests
    - Traditional testing approach: Each test checks one bit of the programs functionality
    - The program gets executed multiple times
    - Better for grading
    - Better for continuous development
    - Example of a normal test (or put it somewhere else?)

- Constraint Tests
    - Different approach: One test executes the program only once and checks defined constraints in the background
    - faster, but less accurate (show difference of average runtime)
    - not everything in this project can be tested in a single run
    - Better for quickly checking the program
    - Example of a constraint test (or put it somewhere else?)
    - Can be used with different sources of input (manual / simulated / random)
    - Instead of passing tests, passing constraints are measured
    - Tests with wrong sprite names are completely excluded in the evaluation

- Random Tests
    - Same constraints as the constraint tests
    - Random input instead of deliberately controlling the bowl
    - Random tests only make sense with constraints
        - defining single test cases would be difficult
        - execution would take a long time because most tests are skipped
    - Useful to test the stability of the program (like Android Monkey)
        - Although not on this particular project
    - This project is not well suited for random tests since random input will quickly result in a game over

Catch fruit with a bowl in order to not go game over and collect as many points as possible before the time is up.

=== Normal Tests
- Manual analysis is used as ground truth

\section{Threats to validity}
- Students often deliberately changed their programs from the specification (e.g. different fall speeds)
    - Tests were adjusted to allow a little more than the specification (e.g. different message)

- For each tests suite, many / all projects were executed in a row
    - Could have a performance impact (?), but Scratch doesn't need a lot of resources
    - If anything, it could have a negative impact on the results, but results are very positive
