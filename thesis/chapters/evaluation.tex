TODO: Introduction

- In this chapter, the Whisker testing utility is evaluated

- 3 Parts
- TODO: explain RQs
    - 1. First it is shown that it is possible to run Whisker tests without interfering with the execution of the Scratch program
    - 2. The main part of the evaluation focuses on finding out how accurate Whisker's test results can be compared to manual assessment (normal + constraint tests)
    - 3. Then Whiskers random input is evaluated

- Chapter outline

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Testing Environment}

We used Whisker through its web GUI to execute test suites on several Scratch programs.
The software and hardware we used are listed in Figure~\ref{tab:evaluation_setup}.
All test executions were performed on the same machine.
For two parts of the evaluation,
specifically to measure execution time and to measure coverage over time,
we used slightly modified versions of Whisker as well as its GUI.

\subsection{Projects Under Test}

This section will list the Scratch projects,
which we used to evaluate Whisker,
and explain, why these projects were chosen.

\subsubsection{(P1) Catching Game}

The first set of Scratch projects consists of 41 student implementations of a simple catching game.
The projects originate from a voluntary Scratch course for 6th and 7th grade students.
In this course, students were introduced to Scratch through several small exercises,
% familiarized themselves with Scratch
building up to the final and most complex exercise to develop the aforementioned catching game.
Students were given a project as a template to fill with their implementation.
\parspace

In this game, apples and bananas periodically fall from the top of the screen.
The player earns points by catching these fruits with a bowl at the bottom of the screen,
which is controlled with the left and right arrow keys.
The game ends when 30 seconds have passed or if an apple touches the ground.
A screenshot of the sample implementation of this program can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot_of_the_sample_implementation}.
Additionally, a summary of the full program specification from the assignment may be found in Table~\ref{tab:project_specification}.
\mnote{TODO: assignment in the appendix?}
\parspace

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{scratch-stage}
    \caption{Screenshot of the sample implementation}
    \label{fig:screenshot_of_the_sample_implementation}
\end{figure}

We will execute various test suites on these programs to analyze their results.
The Scratch projects in this set were manually evaluated and scored for the students course.
This enables us to determine the quality of our test results by using the manually assigned scores as ground truth,
and comparing the results of automated testing to them.
\parspace

The projects are suitable for this evaluation because of two reasons.
Firstly, the task description specifies the program well, which enables us to write automated tests according to the specification.
Secondly, the student solutions are of varying degrees of quality,
which is desirable, so automated tests produce a range of different outcomes.
% Some of the projects implement the game almost perfectly,
% while many contain common errors, and some don't work correctly at all.
However, testing these projects has also revealed some challenges.
For one thing, these projects were never meant to be subject to automated testing.
Therefore, some details, mainly the usage of clones,
are not part of the task specification, which complicates testing,
since tests have to consider multiple options.
Additionally, the game over state, that the program enters,
when an apple touches the ground, also makes automated testing more difficult.
\parspace

Since the students didn't write the programs with automated testing in mind,
some of the projects were unusable for our evaluation for various reasons, so we excluded them from the statistics.
Table~\ref{tab:excluded_projects} shows the excluded projects together with the reasons for excluding them.
The projects are named K6\_S01 through K6\_S33 for 6th grade student solutions
and K7\_S02 through K7\_S27 for 7th grade student solutions respectively (with many numbers being skipped).
Most of the excluded projects were found by analyzing the test reports and the coverage of our test suite,
while two of them were detected manually from a discrepancy between our test results and the manual scoring,
which we will compare our results to later.

% === Excluded Projects
% - Some of the projects were excluded from the evaluation
% - Because they where problematic to automated testing in some way
%     - Tests select sprites and variables by name, and some projects changed the names of sprites and variables
%         - Detected by searching the test reports: ''grep''
%     - Some projects used a different mechanism than the green flag to start their program
%         - Since this is not specified, tests can not start the program
%         - Detected by zero statement coverage
%     - Some Projects didn't work properly because of missing initialization
%         - Go game over on startup
%         - One project work if green flag is pressed multiple times
%         - One project only worked if the sprites were manually dragged to a different position

\end{table}

\subsubsection{(P2) Code Club Projects}

The second set of Scratch projects consists of sample solutions to 24 of Code Club's~\cite{codeclub} Scratch exercises.
Code Club offers free coding projects and step by step guide for programming beginners.
For each project, a sample solution is provided by a volunteer.
\parspace

\mnote{Add a table which lists the projects?}
We use these projects to evaluate Whisker's automated test input generation by measuring its achieved coverage.
The projects work well for this task since they implement a variety of different programs with different input methods.
We chose the sample solutions of the exercises since measuring coverage on working implementation will yield better results.
Broken implementations may be more likely to have unreachable code,
because code might depend on a feature, that is not implemented correctly.

\subsection{Test Suites}

The set of catching game projects (P1) will be tested with three different test suites in order to analyze the quality of test results.
Table~\ref{tab:project_specification} lists which part of the project specification is covered by each test suite.
Additionally, the number of tests or constraints and the size of the test suite in lines of code can be found in Table~\ref{tab:test_suite_statistics}.

\subsubsection{(T1) Normal Test Suite}

This test suite follows an ordinary testing approach.
Each test case runs the program once in order to check one part of the specification.
Tests simulate inputs deliberately and mostly perform assertions between runs of the program.
Listing~\ref{lst:example_test_case_normal} shows a shortened example of a simple test case from this test suite.
% which tests the user interaction with the bowl sprite.
The test suite encompasses 28 test cases, which correspond to the specification in Table~\ref{tab:project_specification}.

For many tests, the catching game has to be played without letting an apple touch the ground for a period of time.
In order to accomplish this we implemented a helper function,
which takes the x coordinates of the apple and bowl sprites and
simulates arrow key presses to move the bowl towards the apple's position.
This function, as well as a usage example, are shown in Listing~\ref{lst:simulating_catching_game}.

\subsubsection{(T2) Input-Independent / Constraint-Only Test Suite}

This test suite implements the input-independent testing approach from Chapter~\ref{cha:using_constraints_to_enable_flexible_test_inputs}.
With this test suite, we tried to test the program with only one execution in total.
Therefore, this test suite only has one test case, which registers 20 constraints to check various parts of the specification
(again corresponding to Table~\ref{tab:project_specification}).
\parspace

This test case deliberately simulates inputs with the goal of winning the game.
We use the same helper method as test suite T1 to simulate key presses depending on the bowl's and the apple's position.
Because of this, the bowl should always catch the apple in working implementations,
and the program should never go game over because of an apple touching the ground.
Nevertheless, we register constraints, which check the game over state in case an apple does reach the ground in a buggy implementation.

\subsubsection{(T3) Random Input Test Suite}

This test suite uses the same constraints as T2, but uses Whisker's automated input generation to control the program with random inputs.
It resets the program multiple times in order to increase the likelihood of multiple apples getting caught in one of the runs.
But, since it is nevertheless very unlikely to have the apple not touch the ground at all with random inputs,
we don't for check for a game over after 30 seconds, and only let the program run for 10 seconds a time.
We reset the program 30 times during the test, resulting in an execution time of $30 \cdot 10s = 300s$.
Listing~\ref{lst:automated_input_random_tests} shows the exact configuration, which use to simulate input for the test case.

\section{RQ1: Accuracy of Test Results}

In this part of the evaluation, we will answer the following research question:

\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
    \textbf{RQ1: Can results of automated testing be accurate enough to aid in grading Scratch assignments?}
\end{minipage}\end{center}

\noindent In order to answer this question,
executed test suites T1-T3 on the catching game projects (P1) five times,
and analyzed the quality of the results.
In order to useful for grading,
test results have to indicate the same grades,
which one would assign the programs through manual assessment.
Test outcomes also have to be consistent over multiple runs,
since inconsistent results would lead to unfair grades.
Therefore, we analyzed the results with respect to two indicators:
\parspace

\textbf{Correlation of tests results and manual scoring.}
Firstly, we compared the test results to manually assigned scores, which we use as ground truth.
Intuitively, a higher score means that more tests (or constraints) should pass,
while a lower score should result in fewer test (or constraint) passes.
Therefore, we use the correlation between test passes and manual scores as an indicator.
We measure the correlation through Pearson's correlation coefficient, which is denoted be $r$.
$r$ can take on values in the range of $[-1, 1]$.
A high correlation coefficient indicates a strong relationship between two values,
while lower correlation coefficients indicate a weaker relationship.
Usually a value of $r \ge 0.5$ is considered to indicate a strong correlation.
Negative values indicate a reverse relationship, which is not relevant for our observations.
\parspace

% \textbf{Average consistency of test outcomes over multiple runs.}
% Secondly, we analyzed how consistent the test cases are.
% In automated testing, test cases can often yield different results when executed multiple times.
% Test cases like this are known as ''flaky tests''.
% This inconsistency of test results can be caused either by the program under test or by the test case itself.
% We measure the number of test-project pairs with inconsistent results over multiple test executions,
% and use their percentage of all test-project pairs to indicate the flakiness of our test suites.

\subsection{Correlation of tests results and manual scoring}

\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$):}
The number of test passes and the results of manual scoring show only a weak correlation or no correlation at all.
\vspace{-\medskipamount}
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):}
The number of test passes closely match manually assigned scores.
They have a strong correlation.
\parspace

\subsubsection{Normal Test Suite (T1)}

Figure~\ref{fig:scatter_normal} compares the test results of test suite T1 to scores from a manual evaluation of projects P1.
Possible values for the manual scores are in the range of $[0, 30]$ and possible values for the number of test passes are in the range of $[0, 28]$.
The blue line displays the linear regression.
We can observe, that the number of passing test cases are strongly correlated to the manual scores,
with a correlation coefficient of $r = 0.8918$ for the first run and $r = 0.8913$ for the average over 3 runs.
Except for few irregularities, the test results closely resemble the manually assigned scores.

\subsubsection{Input-Independent / Constraint-Only Test Suite (T2)}

Figure~\ref{fig:scatter_constraint} compares the test outcomes of test suite T2 to the manual scores.
Possible values for the number of constraint passes are in the range of $[0, 20]$.
We can, again, observe a strong correlation between the two scores,
with a correlation coefficient of $r = 0.8877$ for the first run and $r = 0.8968$ for the average over 3 runs.

\subsubsection{Random Input Test Suite (T3)}

Figure~\ref{fig:scatter_constraint} compares the test outcomes of test suite T2 to the manual scores.
Possible values for the number of constraint passes are in the range of $[0, 18]$.
The result, again, indicate a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of $r = 0.8629$ for the first run and $r = TODO$ for the average over 3 runs.

\subsection{Consistency of test outcomes over multiple runs}

\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$):}
Automated test results show very different results each run and are thus not accurate enough for grading purposes.
\vspace{-\medskipamount}
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):}
Test results are consistent enough over multiple runs to provide accurate information for grading.

In order to analyze which test cases where inconsistent for each project, and vice versa,
we construct matrices over the test cases in T1-T3, and the projects in P1.
If a test case shows inconsistent results on a certain project over five test executions,
we assign a $1$ to the respective cell in the matrix, otherwise we assign a 0.
For this, we consider both ''skipped'' and ''failed'' to be the same test outcome, since both are non-passing test results.
The matrix's sum of rows then shows us how may projects showed inconsistent test results for each test case,
and the sum of columns shows the number of test cases with inconsistent outcomes for each project.
Table~\ref{tab:inconsistencies_matrices_excerpt} shows excerpts of the resulting matrices for demonstration.
The full matrices can be found in the appendix in Section~\ref{sec:inconsistencies_matrices}.

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:consistency_per_test_normal} shows the number of inconsistent test-project pairs per test case of T1.
The horizontal line displays the average number of inconsistencies per test case.
Figure~\ref{fig:consistency_per_project_normal} shows the number of inconsistent test-projects pairs per project.
We can observe that some test cases and some projects tend to be rather inconsistent,
with a maximum of $5$ inconsistent projects ($16.13\%$ of projects) per test case and $5$ inconsistent test cases ($17.86\%$ of test cases) per project.
However, on average only $1.06$ projects per test case and $1.18$ test cases per project show inconsistent results.
This amounts to $3.80\%$ of all test-project pairs, which is still consistent enough for grading purposes.

On average, $2.94$ projects per constraint and $1.71$ constraints per project show inconsistent results,
which amounts to $9.58\%$ of all constraint-project pairs.
Since this test suite is non-deterministic and executed the program under test multiple times, this increase in inconsistent outcomes is expected.

\subsection{Causes for inconsistent test outcomes}

\mnote{In the discussion, write that Scratch programs tend to be inconsistent / non-deterministic because of their multimedia nature}
Inconsistent test outcomes can be caused by either the test or the project under test.
Therefore, we analyzed the inconsistencies of test suite T1 and their cause in Table~\ref{tab:inconsistencies_causes_normal}.
Most of them are caused by projects behaving in a non-deterministic manner,
tough some are caused by test cases themselves.
We noticed that tests, which deal with the banana sprite, i.e. test cases $13, 14, 15, 17, 23, 24, 25$ all have a high number of inconsistent results.
We observed two reasons for this:
Firstly, we suspect that students did not pay much attention to the banana sprite, since it is not essential to play the game.
A banana, which touches the ground, just subtracts points, while an apple, that falls to the ground, ends the game.
Therefore, the banana sprite is often poorly implemented, which causes it to be inconsistent.
Secondly, tests, which deal with the banana sprite are more likely to be inconsistent.
In order to not go game over, tests have to periodically catch the falling apple with the bowl.
This means, that the tests do not always, and are not always even able to, catch bananas with the bowl,
which introduces inconsistency to tests, which rely on the behaviour of the banana.

        K6\_S03 & 8    & Project & Program moves banana to a random position on the ground when right arrow key is pressed.
                                   Therefore the test has different outcomes depending if the apple spawns left or right of the bowl. \\
        K6\_S33 & 8    & Both    & Test waits for 250ms to let the program initialize, then waits for a banana to appear at the top of the screen.
                                   K6\_S33 lets the banana fall instantly instead of waiting for a second (as specified),
                                   causing the banana to be below the tests threshold for detecting the banana ($y > 100$) after 250ms. \\

        K6\_S10 & 13   & Project & Program checks if the apple touches the ground with Scratch's "touching edge" primitive.
                                   Therefore, the program sometimes goes game over when an apple randomly spawns too much to the side of the screen and touches a vertical edge. \\
        K7\_S03 & 13   & Project & Program does not move banana to the top of the screen when it touches the ground, only when it touches the bowl.
                                   Therefore, the banana stays on the ground and is moved only when bowl moves over it, making banana re-spawns dependent on apple spawn locations. \\
        K7\_S07 & 13   & Project & Test checks if a certain number of bananas spawn in 30 seconds.
                                   Bananas fall very slowly in this project.
                                   Because of this, enough bananas spawn if multiple bananas are randomly caught by the bowl,
                                   but too few bananas spawn if bananas fall to the ground instead, because they have to travel more distance before they re-appear. \\

        K6\_S02 & 14   & Project & Banana get stuck in the ground and only re-spawns if touched by the bowl. \\
        K6\_S10 & 14   & Test    & Test checks if bananas spawn at random x coordinates.
                                   The program uses clones for fruit sprites.
                                   The test detects the original sprite and the clone as two banana instances at the same x coordinate concludes that bananas spawn at the same x coordinate. \\
        K7\_S12 & 14   & Test    & Test checks if bananas spawn in random positions, and failed because it detected two bananas spawning in the same position.
                                   In order to speed up test executions, we decided to wait for only two bananas to spawn and compare their positions.
                                   Therefore, while unlikely, it is possible that two bananas spawn in the same place by random chance, which fails the test. \\

        K7\_S17 & 19   & Project & Programs are supposed to check if the apple touches the color of the red stripe at the bottom to detect when the apple touches the ground.
                                   K7\_S17 checks for the wrong shade of red which is only present in some places, at the transition of the background and the red line.
                                   Therefore sprites are sometimes not detected touching the ground, and simply stay at the bottom of the screen. \\

        K6\_S05 & 20   & Project & To move the banana to a random position whenever it spawns,
                                   the program uses Scratch's builtin ''go to random position'', which moves it to a random y coordinate as well.
                                   Afterwards, it immediately adjusts the bananas y coordinate.
                                   But for a split second, the banana may touch the bowl or the ground without interaction, which the test detects. \\

        K7\_S02 & 21   & Both    & Program moves the apple to a random position on the ground 2 seconds after game over, causing the test to recognize it as not game over.
                                   The test could wait longer before performing checks to circumvent this problem. \\
        K7\_S10 & 21   & Project & Banana sometimes re-appears one more time after game over. \\
        K6\_S10 & 23   & Test    & Test relies on the banana touching the bowl, but only follows the apple with the bowl in order to not go game over.
                                   Therefore, sometimes the banana does not touch the bowl at all, resulting in a failing test. \\
        K6\_S19 & 23   & Test    & The test checks if score is added when the apple touches the bowl.
                                   It is skipped if the apple and the banana touch the bowl / ground in quick succession,
                                   because the wrong score change might be considered, or the two score changes might happen in the same step. \\

        K6\_S02 & 27   & Both    & Banana can get stuck in the ground and continually subtract points for a short time after the time is up. \\
        K6\_S19 & 27   & Both    & Banana sometimes still falls for a short time after the time is up. \\

\section{RQ2: Automated Input Generation}
% \subsection{Evaluation Method}
% \subsection{Data Selection}
% \subsection{Threats to Validity}

\mnote{For random tests, expect only average results to be usable, because of how the caching game works\\TODO: add the coverage ''test''}

For this part of the evaluation, we will consider following research question:

\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
    \textbf{RQ2: Is automated test input generation a viable method to control Scratch programs for testing purposes?}
\end{minipage}\end{center}

\noindent In RQ1, we already showed, that getting accurate test results with random input is possible.
In order to get good test results generally, the generated input needs to be able to execute as much of the program as possible.
Intuitively, the more of a program gets executed, the more of the its functionality can be checked by tests running on it.
Therefore, we want to find out how much of a typical Scratch program's functionality can be reached by controlling it through Whisker's generated user input.
In order to measure how much of the program is reached, we will use the achieved statement coverage as an indicator.
\parspace

We ran Whisker's automated input generation algorithm on the Code Club Scratch projects (P2),
and measured the current statement coverage each second during the execution.
Each program was run for five minutes and was reset five times during that time,
resulting five one-minute executions of the program.
We use the mean final statement coverage on the projects to indicate how much of the programs is reached by the automated input.
To get more consistent results, we ran this experiment five times, and took the average of the final coverage scores.
Listing~\ref{lst:coverage_test} shows the code, which we used to run the programs.
In order to access the coverage during the execution we implemented a function called \texttt{logCoverage},
which saves the current statement coverage of the program and outputs all saved coverage records once the test is over.
\parspace

% \mnote{TODO: remove?}
% \textbf{Correlation of test results and manual scoring.}
% Secondly, we want to determine how accurate results from tests with automatically generated input are.
% For this purpose, we tested the catching game projects (P1) with test suites T3 and T4,
% which are variations of the input-independent test suite T2, that uses Whisker's automated input generation to control the program.
% The catching game projects are especially challenging to be tested with automated input,
% since the catching game has a game over state, which is difficult to avoid.
% Like in RQ1, we use the correlation between test results and manual scores as an indicator of the test results' quality.

\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$):}
Automated input generation can only cover a small fraction of typical Scratch programs, making it unfeasible for testing purposes.
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):}
Automated input generation is able to reach most of typical Scratch programs' functionality, making it a viable method to control the Scratch programs for testing.

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:coverage} shows the statement coverage, which we were able to achieve on the Code Club projects (P2) by using Whisker's automatically generated input,
as well as the execution time at which the coverage was achieved.
The black line in Figure~\ref{fig:coverage_line} displays the mean coverage of the projects over time.
After ten minutes of run time, we were able to achieve an average coverage of $95.25\%$ with the lowest coverage for a project being $74\%$ and the highest being $100\%$.
We repeated this experiment five times and got similar results, with the mean final coverage over five runs being $TODO\%$.
In comparison, Figure~\ref{fig:coverage_no_input} shows the achieved coverage without simulating any inputs.
Here, we only got an average of $47.04\%$ per project on our first run, and $TODO\%$ averaged over five runs.

\subsection{Reasons for low coverage on certain projects}

Over the five runs with generated input, we observed ''Create Your Own World'' and ''Memory'' to consistently have the lowest coverage of the projects.
% A screenshot of both these programs can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:difficult_code_club_projects}.
We are going to take a quick look at the reasons, why these projects are difficult to cover by using random input.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ''Create Your Own World'' implements a little adventure game with a player sprite, which starts on the left of the screen and is able to move through several rooms through a portal on the right side of the screen.
        This project is difficult to cover, because the sprite needs to move a long way in one direction, to reach a screen transition.
        But because each arrow key has equal probability to be simulated by Whisker, the sprite will likely only hover over a small area around its start position.
    \item In ''Memory'' the player can hit 4 different colored drums.
        The player has to hit them in an order, which is randomly determined by the program.
        If the player hits one drum incorrectly, which includes hitting a drum while no sequence is active, the game goes into a game over state,
        and can only be restarted by pressing the green flag.
        Therefore using random inputs quickly results in an irrecoverable game over,
        because a wrong drum is hit, which renders much of the program's code unreachable.
\end{itemize}

\section{Interference with Programs Under Test}
\label{sec:time_evaluation}

\mnote{No RQ, just another question. Is that ok?}
In the following section, we want to answer another important question:

\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
    \textbf{Does the testing process interfere with the program under test?}
\end{minipage}\end{center}

\subsection{Problem statement}

\noindent Since JavaScript is executed in a single-threaded environment,
Whisker executing code in between steps of the Scratch program can possibly be problematic.
Additional computations could take too long and delay the next step of the program.
Scratch offers blocks which delay the execution of a script for a set amount of time.
These blocks save the current time when called and wait until a certain time difference between the current time and the saved time is reached.
Therefore, if the program is executed too slowly, fewer blocks are executed while the delay is active,
which can make a difference if the program expects to get a certain amount of work done during the wait.
However, we suspect that this will not be a concern for most Scratch programs.
\parspace

Scratch's step function has to be called 30 times per second.
Therefore, the execution time of Whisker's step function, which includes the execution of Scratch's step function,
should not exceed $1000\text{ms}/30 = 33.33\text{ms}$.
Scratch allocates $0.75 * 33.33\text{ms} = 25.0\text{ms}$ of the $33.33\text{ms}$ to execute the program.
If no sprite changes in the program during the step,
the Scratch VM will execute the program for the allocated amount of time.
But if some sprite's position or appearance changes, the VM will stop executing the program earlier.
Afterwards, Scratch draws the new frame in the GUI.
In the worst case, i.e. if no sprite changes and the whole time interval is used to execute the program,
$0.25 * 33.33\text{ms} = 8.33\text{ms}$ will be left to render the new frame.
Most modern hardware will take less time than $8.33\text{ms}$ to render the picture,
which leaves time for Whisker to execute other tasks.
\parspace

We should also note that some of Whisker's optional functionality gets executed during Scratch's step,
which will slow the program down as well, if the full $25\text{ms}$ of execution time are used by Scratch.
This includes coverage measurement and callbacks for sprite changes (e.g. \texttt{t.onSpriteMoved} and \texttt{spite.onMoved}).
However the Scratch GUI itself also registers code to update the GUI, which is run during the step of the VM,
so this should not affect the program, unless the registered callbacks are very expensive to execute.

\subsection{Time measurements}

To evaluate this, we measured the execution time of Whisker's components (see Figure~\ref{fig:whisker_step_procedure})
as well as the execution time of Scratch during each step.
Since we execute Whisker in a web browser,
we were limited to JavaScript's \texttt{performance.now} method to measure execution times.
\texttt{performance.now} returns the time, since which the current web page is open,
with an accuracy of $0.1\text{ms}$.
The code that we used for measuring the execution times can be found in Listing~\ref{lst:time_measurement_code} in the appendix.
\parspace

We executed our test suites T1-T3 on the sample solution of the catching game (P1) ten times,
and measured the execution times of each step.
We will consider the mean times, as well as the maximum times from the ten runs
to decide if the test execution could interfere with the program or not.

\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$):}
The execution of additional code delays the execution of Scratch's steps, which possibly interferes with the program execution.
\vspace{-\medskipamount}
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):}
The execution of additional code introduces no delay. It will therefore not interfere with the program execution.
\parspace

Figure \ref{fig:time_line_plot} shows execution times from the first run of each test suite on the program.
It displays the total execution time of Whisker's step procedure over time.
The time measurements include both the execution time of Whisker and Scratch.
We can see that the execution time is mostly far beneath the limit of $33.33\text{ms}$
and only rarely spikes to higher for short periods of time.

Figure \ref{tab:time_measurements} shows the average and maximum executions times for each part of Whisker's step procedure.
This data is taken from ten consecutive executions of the respective test suite on the program under test.
Again, the average total execution time is far beneath $33.33\text{ms}$.
The execution of test suite T1 spiked over the $33.33\text{ms}$ with a maximum of $35.1\text{ms}$,
but this only happened in one step, with the second longest step execution time for T1 being $31.1\text{ms}$.

% Since the tests execute code between steps in a single threaded environment,
% they could, in theory, interfere with the program by slowing down the step cycle.
% This can make the program behave differently, because Scratch programs use absolute timings (TODO figure).

% ~\\~\\
% Typical tests don't interfere with the execution of typical Scratch programs
% $\rightarrow$ measure how long Scratch takes for a step (WORK\_TIME AND time to render)
% $\rightarrow$ measure how long each operation in the Whisker step procedure takes (e.g. callbacks, sprites, constraints)
% $\rightarrow$ Explain how the times are measured
%
% TODO: explain why testing procedure might interfere with Scratch programs (absolute timings)
% TODO: timing diagram and table of timings for real tests
% TODO: example code for tests that interfere and their test data

% \paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$):}
% Additional computations for testing are to slow to be executed while the program is running and stretch out the average time a step takes.
% \paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):}
% Additional computations for testing can be fast enough to not affect the average step time.

\section{Discussion}

% \mnote{TODO: Move this into discussion}
% This shows that both test suites implementing the ''normal'' testing approach and
% test suites implementing the ''input-indepent'' / ''constraint-only'' testing approach
% are able to produce accurate test results.

\section{Threats to validity}
% - Students often deliberately changed their programs from the specification (e.g. different fall speeds)
%     - Tests were adjusted to allow a little more than the specification (e.g. different message)
%
% - For each tests suite, many / all projects were executed in a row
%     - Could have a performance impact (?), but Scratch doesn't need a lot of resources
%     - If anything, it could have a negative impact on the results, but results are very positive
%
% - Tests could interfere with the program under test (see prev. section)
%     - But Scratch programs don't usually do calculations without moving any sprite
%     - Most time related functionality is based on absolute time, slow-down would not affect it
%
% - Browser JavaScript could be problematic
%
%
% TODO: pick a time length and execute random tests multiple times at that length
