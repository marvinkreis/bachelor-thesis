TODO: Introduction

- In this chapter, the Whisker testing utility is evaluated

- 3 Parts
- TODO: explain RQs
    - 1. First it is shown that it is possible to run Whisker tests without interfering with the execution of the Scratch program
    - 2. The main part of the evaluation focuses on finding out how accurate Whisker's test results can be compared to manual assessment (normal + constraint tests)
    - 3. Then Whiskers random input is evaluated

- Chapter outline

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Testing Environment}

We used Whisker through its web GUI to execute test suites on several Scratch programs.
The software and hardware we used are listed in Figure~\ref{tab:evaluation_setup}.
All test executions were performed on the same machine.
For two parts of the evaluation,
specifically to measure execution time and to measure coverage over time,
we used slightly modified versions of Whisker as well as its GUI.

\subsection{Projects Under Test}

This section will list the Scratch projects,
which we used to evaluate Whisker,
and explain, why these projects were chosen.

\subsubsection{(P1) Catching Game}

The first set of Scratch projects consists of 41 student implementations of a simple catching game.
The projects originate from a voluntary Scratch course for 6th and 7th grade students.
In this course, students were introduced to Scratch through several small exercises,
% familiarized themselves with Scratch
building up to the final and most complex exercise to develop the aforementioned catching game.
Students were given a project as a template to fill with their implementation.
\parspace

In this game, apples and bananas periodically fall from the top of the screen.
The player earns points by catching these fruits with a bowl at the bottom of the screen,
which is controlled with the left and right arrow keys.
The game ends when 30 seconds have passed or if an apple touches the ground.
A screenshot of the sample implementation of this program can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:screenshot_of_the_sample_implementation}.
Additionally, a summary of the full program specification from the assignment may be found in Table~\ref{tab:project_specification}.
\mnote{TODO: assignment in the appendix?}
\parspace

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{scratch-stage}
    \caption{Screenshot of the sample implementation}
    \label{fig:screenshot_of_the_sample_implementation}
\end{figure}

We will execute various test suites on these programs to analyze their results.
The Scratch projects in this set were manually evaluated and scored for the students course.
This enables us to determine the quality of our test results by using the manually assigned scores as ground truth,
and comparing the results of automated testing to them.
\parspace

The projects are suitable for this evaluation because of two reasons.
Firstly, the task description specifies the program well, which enables us to write automated tests according to the specification.
Secondly, the student solutions are of varying degrees of quality,
which is desirable, so automated tests produce a range of different outcomes.
% Some of the projects implement the game almost perfectly,
% while many contain common errors, and some don't work correctly at all.
However, testing these projects has also revealed some challenges.
For one thing, these projects were never meant to be subject to automated testing.
Therefore, some details, mainly the usage of clones,
are not part of the task specification, which complicates testing,
since tests have to consider multiple options.
Additionally, the game over state, that the program enters,
when an apple touches the ground, also makes automated testing more difficult.
\parspace

Since the students didn't write the programs with automated testing in mind,
some of the projects were unusable for our evaluation for various reasons, so we excluded them from the statistics.
Table~\ref{tab:excluded_projects} shows the excluded projects together with the reasons for excluding them.
The projects are named K6\_S01 through K6\_S33 for 6th grade student solutions
and K7\_S02 through K7\_S27 for 7th grade student solutions respectively (with many numbers being skipped).
Most of the excluded projects were found by analyzing the test reports and the coverage of our test suite,
while two of them were detected manually from a discrepancy between our test results and the manual scoring,
which we will compare our results to later.

% === Excluded Projects
% - Some of the projects were excluded from the evaluation
% - Because they where problematic to automated testing in some way
%     - Tests select sprites and variables by name, and some projects changed the names of sprites and variables
%         - Detected by searching the test reports: ''grep''
%     - Some projects used a different mechanism than the green flag to start their program
%         - Since this is not specified, tests can not start the program
%         - Detected by zero statement coverage
%     - Some Projects didn't work properly because of missing initialization
%         - Go game over on startup
%         - One project work if green flag is pressed multiple times
%         - One project only worked if the sprites were manually dragged to a different position

        \bottomrule

\end{table}

\subsubsection{(P2) Code Club Projects}

The second set of Scratch projects consists of sample solutions to 24 of Code Club's~\cite{codeclub} Scratch exercises.
Code Club offers free coding projects and step by step guide for programming beginners.
For each project, a sample solution is provided by a volunteer.
\parspace

\mnote{Add a table which lists the projects?}
We use these projects to evaluate Whisker's automated test input generation by measuring its achieved coverage.
The projects work well for this task since they implement a variety of different programs with different input methods.
We chose the sample solutions of the exercises since measuring coverage on working implementation will yield better results.
Broken implementations may be more likely to have unreachable code,
because code might depend on a feature, that is not implemented correctly.

\subsection{Test Suites}

The set of catching game projects (P1) will be tested with three different test suites in order to analyze the quality of test results.
Table~\ref{tab:project_specification} lists which part of the project specification is covered by each test suite.
Additionally, the number of tests or constraints and the size of the test suite in lines of code can be found in Table~\ref{tab:test_suite_statistics}.

\subsubsection{(T1) Normal Test Suite}

This test suite follows an ordinary testing approach.
Each test case runs the program once in order to check one part of the specification.
Tests simulate inputs deliberately and mostly perform assertions between runs of the program.
Listing~\ref{lst:example_test_case_normal} shows a shortened example of a simple test case from this test suite.
% which tests the user interaction with the bowl sprite.
The test suite encompasses 28 test cases, which correspond to the specification in Table~\ref{tab:project_specification}.

For many tests, the catching game has to be played without letting an apple touch the ground for a period of time.
In order to accomplish this we implemented a helper function,
which takes the x coordinates of the apple and bowl sprites and

\subsubsection{(T2) Input-Independent / Constraint-Only Test Suite}

\mnote{Another difference: T1 accepts ''bad'' movement, T2, T3, T4 does not}
This test suite implements the input-independent testing approach from Chapter~\ref{cha:using_constraints_to_enable_flexible_test_inputs}.
With this test suite, we tried to test the program with only one execution in total.
Therefore, this test suite only has one test case, which registers 20 constraints to check various parts of the specification
(again corresponding to Table~\ref{tab:project_specification}).
\parspace

This test case deliberately simulates inputs with the goal of winning the game.
We use the same helper method as test suite T1 to simulate key presses depending on the bowl's and the apple's position.
Because of this, the bowl should always catch the apple in working implementations,
and the program should never go game over because of an apple touching the ground.
Nevertheless, we register constraints, which check the game over state in case an apple does reach the ground in a buggy implementation.

\subsubsection{(T3) Random Input Test Suite}

Test suite T3 is exactly identical to test suite T2,
but uses Whisker's automated test input generation instead of deliberately simulating inputs.
Listing~\ref{lst:automated_input_random_tests} shows the exact code snippet, which simulates input for the test case.
\parspace

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Automated input generation for random test suites}
    \label{lst:automated_input_random_tests}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{(T4) Random Input Test Suite Lite}

Since performing inputs randomly will likely result in the falling apple touching the ground,
we added T4 as a variant of T3.
T4 works on the assumption, that the first apple will touch the ground and cause a game over.
Therefore, the test suite doesn't test anything, which requires the test to successfully catch the apple with the bowl.
It only registers the 12 of T3's 20 constraints, that are relevant for the first few seconds of the program execution.
Otherwise, T4 is identical to T3.

\section{RQ1: Accuracy of Test Results}

In this part of the evaluation, we will analyze the quality of test results from our test suites to answer the following research question:

\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{.9\textwidth}
Can results of automated testing be accurate enough to aid in grading Scratch assignments?
\end{minipage}\end{center}

\noindent In order to useful for grading,
test results have to indicate the same grades,
which one would assign the programs through manual assessment.
Test outcome also have to be consistent over multiple runs,
since inconsistent results would lead to unfair grades.
Therefore, we executed test suites T1 and T2 on the catching game projects (P1) five times,
and analyzed the results with respect to two indicators:
\parspace

\textbf{Correlation of tests results and manual scoring.}
Firstly, we compared the test results to manually assigned scores, which we use as ground truth.
Intuitively, a higher score means that more tests (or constraints) should pass,
while a lower score should result in fewer test (or constraint) passes.
Therefore, we use the correlation between test passes and manual scores as an indicator.
We measure the correlation through Pearson's correlation coefficient, which is denoted be $r$.
$r$ can take on values in the range of $[-1, 1]$.
A high correlation coefficient indicates a strong relationship between two values,
while lower correlation coefficients indicate a weaker relationship.
Usually a value of $r \ge 0.5$ is considered to indicate a strong correlation.
Negative values indicate a reverse relationship, which is not relevant for our observations.
\parspace

\textbf{Consistency of test outcomes over multiple runs.}
Secondly, we analyzed how consistent the test cases are.
In automated testing, test cases can often yield different results when executed multiple times.
Test cases like this are known as ''flaky tests''.
This inconsistency of test results can be caused either by the program under test or by the test case itself.
We measure the number of test-project pairs with inconsistent results over multiple test executions,
and use their percentage of all test-project pairs to indicate the flakiness of our test suites.

\subsection{Correlation of tests results and manual scoring}

\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$):}
The number of test passes and the results of manual scoring show only a weak correlation or no correlation at all.
\vspace{-\medskipamount}
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):}
The number of test passes closely match manually assigned scores.
They have a strong correlation.
\parspace

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:scatter_normal} compares the test results of test suite T1 to scores from a manual evaluation of projects P1.
Possible values for the manual scores are in the range of $[0, 30]$ and possible values for the number of test passes are in the range of $[0, 28]$.
We can observe, that the number of passing test cases are strongly correlated to the manual scores,
with a correlation coefficient of $r = 0.8918$ for the first run and $r = 0.8913$ for the average over 3 runs.
Except for few irregularities, the test results closely resemble the manually assigned scores.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:scatter_constraint} shows the same statistic for the test outcomes of test suite T2.
Possible values for the number of constraint passes are in the range of $[0, 20]$.
We can, again, observe a strong correlation between the two scores,
with a correlation coefficient of $r = 0.8877$ for the first run and $r = 0.8968$ for the average over 3 runs.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Comparison between test results of test suite T2 (input-indepent / constraint-only) and manually assigned scores}
    \label{fig:scatter_constraint}
\end{figure}

\mnote{TODO: Move this into discussion}
This shows that both test suites implementing the ''normal'' testing approach and
test suites implementing the ''input-indepent'' / ''constraint-only'' testing approach
are able to produce accurate test results.

\subsection{Consistency of test outcomes over multiple runs}

\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$):}
Automated test results show very different results each run and are thus not accurate enough for grading purposes.
\vspace{-\medskipamount}
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):}
Test results are consistent enough over multiple runs to provide accurate information for grading.
\parspace

In order to analyze inconsistent test-project pairs,
we construct matrices over the test cases in T1 and T2, and the projects in P1.
If a test case shows inconsistent results on a certain project over five test executions,
we assign a $1$ to the respective cell in the matrix, otherwise we assign a 0.
For this, we consider both ''skipped'' and ''failed'' to be the same test outcome, since both are non-passing test results.
Table~\ref{tab:inconsistencies_matrices_excerpt} shows excerpts of the resulting matrices for demonstration.
The full matrices can be found in the appendix in Table~\ref{tab:inconsistencies_matrices}.

\mnote{In the discussion, write that Scratch programs tend to be inconsistent / non-deterministic because of their multimedia nature}
Inconsistent test outcomes can be caused by either the test or the project under test.
Therefore, we analyzed the inconsistencies of test suite T1 and their cause in Table~\ref{tab:inconsistencies_causes_normal}.
Most of them are caused by projects behaving in a non-deterministic manner,
tough some are caused by test cases themselves.
We noticed that tests, which deal with the banana sprite, i.e. test cases $13, 14, 15, 17, 23, 24, 25$ all have a high number of inconsistent results.
We observed two reasons for this:
Firstly, we suspect that students did not pay much attention to the banana sprite, since it is not essential to play the game.
A banana, which touches the ground, just subtracts points, while an apple, that falls to the ground, ends the game.
Therefore, the banana sprite is often poorly implemented, which causes it to be inconsistent.
Secondly, tests, which deal with the banana sprite are more likely to be inconsistent.
In order to not go game over, tests have to periodically catch the falling apple with the bowl.
This means, that the tests do not always, and are not always even able to, catch bananas with the bowl,
which introduces inconsistency to tests, which rely on the behaviour of the banana.

        K7\_S16 & 4    & Project & Program sometimes goes game over directly after being started. \\

        K6\_S03 & 8    & Project & Program moves banana to a random position on the ground when right arrow key is pressed.
                                   Therefore the test has different outcomes depending if the apple spawns left or right of the bowl. \\
        K6\_S33 & 8    & Both    & Test waits for 250ms to let the program initialize, then waits for a banana to appear at the top of the screen.
                                   K6\_S33 lets the banana fall instantly instead of waiting for a second (as specified),
                                   causing the banana to be below the tests threshold for detecting the banana ($y > 100$) after 250ms. \\

        K6\_S10 & 13   & Project & Program checks if the apple touches the ground with Scratch's "touching edge" primitive.
                                   Therefore, the program sometimes goes game over when an apple randomly spawns too much to the side of the screen and touches a vertical edge. \\
        K7\_S03 & 13   & Project & Program does not move banana to the top of the screen when it touches the ground, only when it touches the bowl.
                                   Therefore, the banana stays on the ground and is moved only when bowl moves over it, making banana re-spawns dependent on apple spawn locations. \\
        K7\_S07 & 13   & Project & Test checks if a certain number of bananas spawn in 30 seconds.
                                   Bananas fall very slowly in this project.
                                   Because of this, enough bananas spawn if multiple bananas are randomly caught by the bowl,
                                   but too few bananas spawn if bananas fall to the ground instead, because they have to travel more distance before they re-appear. \\

        K6\_S02 & 14   & Project & Banana get stuck in the ground and only re-spawns if touched by the bowl. \\
        K6\_S10 & 14   & Test    & Test checks if bananas spawn at random x coordinates.
                                   The program uses clones for fruit sprites.
                                   The test detects the original sprite and the clone as two banana instances at the same x coordinate concludes that bananas spawn at the same x coordinate. \\
        K7\_S12 & 14   & Unknown & Test failed because it detected three bananas spawning in the same position.
                                   We are unsure why this happened, and could not reproduce the test outcome. \\

        K7\_S17 & 19   & Project & Programs are supposed to check if the apple touches the color of the red stripe at the bottom to detect when the apple touches the ground.
                                   K7\_S17 checks for the wrong shade of red which is only present in some places, at the transition of the background and the red line.
                                   Therefore sprites are sometimes not detected touching the ground, and simply stay at the bottom of the screen. \\

        K6\_S05 & 20   & Project & To move the banana to a random position whenever it spawns,
                                   the program uses Scratch's builtin ''go to random position'', which moves it to a random y coordinate as well.
                                   Afterwards, it immediately adjusts the bananas y coordinate.
                                   But for a split second, the banana may touch the bowl or the ground without interaction, which the test detects. \\

        K7\_S02 & 21   & Both    & Program moves the apple to a random position on the ground 2 seconds after game over, causing the test to recognize it as not game over.
                                   The test could wait longer before performing checks to circumvent this problem. \\
        K7\_S10 & 21   & Project & Banana sometimes re-appears one more time after game over. \\
        K6\_S10 & 23   & Test    & Test relies on the banana touching the bowl, but only follows the apple with the bowl in order to not go game over.

% We base our observations (?) on two different key indicators.
% - Automatic testing can facilitate grading of Scratch assignments
%     (1) test results (normal tests and constraint tests) match the results of manual evaluation
%     (3) test results (normal tests and constraint tests) are consistent enough to be used for grading
%         $\rightarrow$ Plot difference number of test passes per project
%         $\rightarrow$ Check average difference

% \subsection{Evaluation Method}
% \subsection{Data Selection}
% \subsection{Threats to Validity}

\mnote{Add the random input ''test''}

- The testing process can be done entirely in the background independent of testing scenarios (?)
    $\rightarrow$ Random input can be used for the test
    $\rightarrow$ The test can involve the user using the program like they normally would

% - Constraint Tests
%     - Different approach: One test executes the program only once and checks defined constraints in the background, see Section \ref{sec:constraint_only_tests}
%     - Deliberately control the bowl to win the game
%     - faster, but can be less accurate (show difference of average runtime)
%     - not everything in this project can be tested in a single run
%     - Better for quickly checking the program
%     - Example of a constraint test (or put it somewhere else?)
%     - Can be used with different sources of input (manual / simulated / random)
%     - Instead of passing tests, passing constraints are measured
%     - Tests with wrong sprite names are completely excluded in the evaluation

- Automatic test input generation
- Same constraints as the constraint tests vs. only constraints that can hold in the first few seconds every time
    - Random input instead of deliberately controlling the bowl
    - Useful to test the stability of the program (like Android Monkey \cite{androidmonkey})
    - The catching game is not well suited for this approach since random input will quickly result in a game over

TODO: discuss test results
TODO: discuss coverage results

\section{RQ3: Interference with Programs Under Test}

Since the tests execute code between steps in a single threaded environment,
they could, in theory, interfere with the program by slowing down the step cycle.
This can make the program behave differently, because Scratch programs use absolute timings (TODO figure).

~\\~\\
Typical tests don't interfere with the execution of typical Scratch programs
$\rightarrow$ measure how long Scratch takes for a step (WORK\_TIME AND time to render)
$\rightarrow$ measure how long each operation in the Whisker step procedure takes (e.g. callbacks, sprites, constraints)
$\rightarrow$ Explain how the times are measured

TODO: explain why testing procedure might interfere with Scratch programs (absolute timings)
TODO: timing diagram and table of timings for real tests
TODO: example code for tests that interfere and their test data

~\\~\\
\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$)}
Additional computations for testing are to slow to be executed while the program is running and stretch out the average time a step takes.
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)}
Additional computations for testing can be fast enough to not affect the average step time.



\section{Threats to validity}
- Students often deliberately changed their programs from the specification (e.g. different fall speeds)
    - Tests were adjusted to allow a little more than the specification (e.g. different message)

- For each tests suite, many / all projects were executed in a row
    - Could have a performance impact (?), but Scratch doesn't need a lot of resources
    - If anything, it could have a negative impact on the results, but results are very positive

- Tests could interfere with the program under test (see prev. section)
    - But Scratch programs don't usually do calculations without moving any sprite
    - Most time related functionality is based on absolute time, slow-down would not affect it

- Browser JavaScript could be problematic


TODO: pick a time length and execute random tests multiple times at that length
