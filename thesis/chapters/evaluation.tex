\chapter{Evaluation}%
\label{cha:evaluation}

- In this chapter, the Whisker testing utility is evaluated
- The evaluation focuses on finding out how accurate Whisker's test results can be compared to manual assessment
- Additionally the results of using different methods of input in conjunction to constraint-only tests is explored
- A collection of real Scratch programs from a student course is tested with four different test suites

- Chapter outline

\section{Evaluation Method}

- TODO: write about the general evaluation approach

=== Scratch Projects:
- From a students course
- Two groups, grade 6 and grade 7 $\rightarrow$ realistic for Whisker's purpose
- Multiple exercises to familiarize themselves with Scratch
- Build up to final, most complex, project
- Project has a clear description that stretches about half a DIN A4 page $\rightarrow$ well defined

=== Are these projects suitable for evaluating Whisker?
- Complexity on the higher end of what Whisker is supposed to be used for
- Game Over state makes it hard to assess other properties if the program goes game over because of a bug
    - E.g. one project would often go game over when an apple touches the borders on the sides
    - Well defined $\rightarrow$ tests can be written without looking at the projects (but often problematic, e.g. clones, inexact implementations)
- Students were not aware of the fact, that their projects would be subjected to automated assessment later
    - Students often deliberately changed their programs from the specification (e.g. different fall speeds, different messages)
    - In a real scenario (in which Whisker is used for grading) students would have the possibility to test their projects beforehand
    $\rightarrow$ see Chapter 2 - Advantages

Catch fruit with a bowl in order to not go game over and collect as many points as possible before the time is up.

\section{Research Questions}

\textbf{RQ1.}
- Whisker can facilitate grading of Scratch assignments
    (1) Whisker's results (normal tests and constraint tests) match the results of manual evaluation
    (2) Whisker's results (normal tests and constraint tests) show low rates of false positives and false negatives
    (3) Whisker's results (normal tests and constraint tests) are consistent enough to be used for grading

~\\~\\
=== (1)
\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$)}
Test results have no strong relation to the scores that were given to the projects manually.
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)}
The results of automated tests closely match the results of manual scoring.

~\\~\\
=== (2)
\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$)}
Automated test results show a high rate of false positives and false negatives, which makes it unsuitable for grading.
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)}
The test results show a low enough rate of false positives and false negatives to make it suitable for grading.

~\\~\\
=== (3)
\paragraph{Null hypothesis ($H_0$)}
Automated test results show very different results each run and are thus not accurate enough to use them for grading.
\paragraph{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)}
Test results are consistent enough over multiple runs to provide accurate information for grading.

~\\~\\
- Normal Tests
    - Traditional testing approach: Each test checks one bit of the programs functionality
    - The program gets executed multiple times
    - Deliberately control the bowl to win the game
    - Better for grading
    - Better for continuous development
    - Example of a normal test (or put it somewhere else?)

\textbf{RQ2.}
- The testing process can be done entirely in the background independent of testing scenarios (?)
    $\rightarrow$ Random input can be used for the test
    $\rightarrow$ The test can involve the user using the program like they normally would

- Constraint Tests
    - Different approach: One test executes the program only once and checks defined constraints in the background
    - Deliberately control the bowl to win the game
    - faster, but can be less accurate (show difference of average runtime)
    - not everything in this project can be tested in a single run
    - Better for quickly checking the program
    - Example of a constraint test (or put it somewhere else?)
    - Can be used with different sources of input (manual / simulated / random)
    - Instead of passing tests, passing constraints are measured
    - Tests with wrong sprite names are completely excluded in the evaluation

- Random Tests
- Same constraints as the constraint tests vs. only constraints that can hold in the first few seconds every time
    - Random input instead of deliberately controlling the bowl
    - Random tests only make sense with constraints
        - defining single test cases would be difficult
        - execution would take a long time because most tests are skipped
    - Useful to test the stability of the program (like Android Monkey)
        - Although not on this particular project
    - This project is not well suited for random tests since random input will quickly result in a game over

\end{figure}

=== Excluded Projects
- Some of the projects were excluded from the evaluation
- Because they where problematic to automated testing in some way
    - Tests select sprites and variables by name, and some projects changed the names of sprites and variables
        - Detected by searching the test reports: ''grep''
    - Some projects used a different mechanism than the green flag to start their program
        - Since this is not specified, tests can not start the program
        - Detected by zero statement coverage
    - Some Projects didn't work properly because of missing initialization
        - Go game over on startup
        - One project work if green flag is pressed multiple times
        - One project only worked if the sprites were manually dragged to a different position

=== Normal Tests
- Manual analysis is used as ground truth

\section{Threats to validity}
- Students often deliberately changed their programs from the specification (e.g. different fall speeds)
    - Tests were adjusted to allow a little more than the specification (e.g. different message)

- For each tests suite, many / all projects were executed in a row
    - Could have a performance impact (?), but Scratch doesn't need a lot of resources
    - If anything, it could have a negative impact on the results, but results are very positive
